# FTC Scouting Web App
  The FTC Scouting Web App is a progressive web app designed for mobile and desktop usage. It is currently a WIP, but features will include scouting sheet creation, linking with Google Sheets for data sharing and storage, and offline usage (hence the PWA). The app is hosted at [aaroncook.xyz](aaroncook.xyz/ftc_scouting/index.html).

## Usage
  The FTC Scouting Web App is fully open source (see [LICENSE.md](LICENSE.md)) and free to use for all FTC teams.
